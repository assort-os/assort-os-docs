# Assort OS Documentation

## Current Status
- We are building toward **V10.4**
- This site currently publishes the **V10.3 Locked Source Bundle** for safe reference

## Source of Truth Rule
- The locked source files live in **/source/**
- We will progressively convert them into clean markdown pages inside **/docs/**
- No manual edits to system outputs; fix inputs or masters only
